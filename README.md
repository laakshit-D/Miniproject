## UNDER-CONSTRUCTION BUILDING DAMAGE DETECTION AND PREDICTION
Under-Construction Building Damage Detection and Prediction is a project focused on identifying and assessing structural damages in buildings during construction phases using advanced technologies like image processing, sensors, and machine learning. The system can detect early signs of damage, predict potential risks, and suggest corrective measures to ensure safety and reduce costs.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
This project focuses on developing a system to detect and predict damages in under-construction buildings using advanced tools and techniques. Construction sites are prone to structural vulnerabilities due to factors like material flaws, environmental conditions, or human errors. Early detection and prediction of these issues can save resources, ensure worker safety, and maintain the project's timeline.
The project involves collecting data from sensors, images, or other inputs and analyzing it using machine learning or AI models. These models identify existing damages, such as cracks or material degradation, and predict future risks. The system can also provide actionable insights to mitigate potential problems, enhancing the reliability and safety of the construction process.
