## Detecting Urban Infrastructure Damage: Real-Time AI-Powered Monitoring and Prediction System
A real-time damage detection and prediction system leveraging advanced AI models to monitor and ensure the longevity of urban infrastructure, enhancing safety and proactive maintenance strategies.

## About
This project addresses the critical challenge of aging urban infrastructure by developing a real-time monitoring and predictive system capable of identifying and forecasting damage such as cracks, corrosion, and misalignments. The system employs a YOLO Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze temporal data trends collected from structural health monitoring (SHM) sensors. By integrating these models, the system can detect visible damage and predict future failures effectively.

Using OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for model training, this system applies state-of-the-art AI techniques to enhance urban infrastructure safety and sustainability. The solution is scalable, making it applicable across various infrastructure types, from roads to bridges and pipelines.
